  <span style="font-family: pxfonts;"><font size="3">This paper studies the impacts of initial labor market conditions on young economists' early-career co-authorship networks and academic achievements. The identification leverages the plausibly exogenous variation in labor market conditions at initial entry instrumented by the unemployment rates of the predicted year of graduation. Using our three novel datasets (PhD Candidate, Top5 Co-authorship Network, and NBER Affiliated Scholar), we find that economists graduating during periods of elevated unemployment rates demonstrate expanded social networks and increased research output; however, the impact on research output diminishes after the fifth year following graduation. Furthermore, our findings suggest that recession economists who are male and non-US citizens encounter reduced probabilities of securing tenure positions at prestigious academic institutions. Additionally, our analysis of heterogeneity suggests that the effects of adverse initial labor market conditions are primarily driven by economists who are white, male, non-US citizens, and graduating from tier 1 schools. We also explore the mechanisms underlying the effect of initial labor market conditions. The findings suggest that the increased extrinsic motivation may enhance social networks and research output during the initial four years, the anticipated attainment of tenure and the pursuit of post-doctoral positions may partially explain the reversal of impact in later years, and non-research factors may explain the diminished likelihood of achieving tenure at prestigious academic institutions.</font></span>

<span style="font-family: pxfonts;">"Beyond Economic Benefits: Early Legal Access to Oral Contraceptives and Women’s Health Outcomes Over Life Cycle"</span>
  <details style="margin-top: 10px; background-color:#fbfffa;">
  <summary style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: pxfonts;"><font size="3">Abstract</font></span></summary>
  <span style="font-family: pxfonts;"><font size="3">This paper investigates the effects of early legal access to oral contraceptives on women’s life-cycle health outcomes (e.g., mortality and self-reported disability) using the plausible quasi-experimental design introduced by Goldin and Katz (2002). The identification leverages the cross-state and cross-cohort variation in state consent laws. Utilizing the difference-in-differences approach, our results suggest that early access to the pill reduces women's mortality rates during their 30s and 40s, and the improvement in health is primarily driven by the decline in mortality rate caused by cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Also, we find that women who would have had early access to the pill are, on average, more likely to have self-reported physical disability during their late 50s and 60s. Additionally, our analysis reveals that non-white women experience greater benefits from early pill access. Our mechanism analysis identifies four potential channels: early access to the pill (1) rises in college completion, (2) increases (decreases) in oral contraceptive-related mortality, (3) increases (decreases) in health behavior measures, and (4) enhances life expectancy.</font></span>

- Exchange Rate Volatility and International Students’ Educational Choice: Evidence from US (Draft available upon request)

    <details style="font-size:80%; background-color:#fffbfa;">
    <summary style="color:#a51417; font-family:courier; font-size:100%;"> Abstract </summary> 
    Does the economic situation prevailing in the home country of an international student affect his/her educational choice in the US? To address this question, I use exchange rates as an exogenous price shocks to the international students’ budget constraint to pay for higher education in the host country. To theorize, in response to changes in real exchange rates, how the foreign students’ demand for US higher education is affected is studied in this paper. I present a theoretical model to understand the migration and enrollment decisions of international students in the US institutions when exchange rates fluctuate and test it empirically. For estimation, data from several sources for 2000-2020 time-period is used. I find that the international undergraduate enrollment decreases as price of education increases due to fluctuations in the exchange rate. As undergraduate students have to bear their entire cost of education, so a strong US currency creates a burden on their finances thereby reducing enrollments. However, the same relationship doesn't hold true for graduate enrollment indicating that foreign students are less sensitive to changes in prices of education caused by exchange rates volatility. The paper also exploits other macroeconomic indicators and availability of substitutes in the home country that affects foreign demand for US higher education.

- The Effect of Affordable Care Act (ACA) on Insurance Coverage by the US Natives and Immigrants (Draft available upon request)

    <details style="font-size:80%; background-color:#fffbfa;">
    <summary style="color:#a51417; font-family:courier; font-size:100%;"> Abstract </summary> 
    The Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 included an expansion of Medicaid public health insurance to more low income individuals beginning in 2014. The ACA aimed to achieve nearly universal health insurance coverage in the United States through a combination of mandates, regulations on insurers, expanding Medicaid subsidies and health insurance exchanges, most of which took effect in 2014. This paper estimates the effects of the ACA on health insurance coverage using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) by utilizing difference-in-difference-in-differences model that exploit cross-sectional variation in the intensity of treatment arising from state participation in the Medicaid expansion in 2014 and comparing the effects among natives and immigrants. This study contributes to understand the limits of the ACA in reducing disparities in insurance coverage and exploring how patterns of coverage differ for different sources of insurance among the natives and immigrants. It is observed that the gap is lower in magnitude between the natives and immigrants in terms of public and Medicaid insurance coverage after the ACA implementation.
