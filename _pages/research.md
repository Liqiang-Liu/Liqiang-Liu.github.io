  <font size="2">This paper studies the impacts of initial labor market conditions on young economists' early-career co-authorship networks and academic achievements. The identification leverages the plausibly exogenous variation in labor market conditions at initial entry instrumented by the unemployment rates of the predicted year of graduation. Using our three novel datasets (PhD Candidate, Top5 Co-authorship Network, and NBER Affiliated Scholar), we find that economists graduating during periods of elevated unemployment rates demonstrate expanded social networks and increased research output; however, the impact on research output diminishes after the fifth year following graduation. Furthermore, our findings suggest that recession economists who are male and non-US citizens encounter reduced probabilities of securing tenure positions at prestigious academic institutions. Additionally, our analysis of heterogeneity suggests that the effects of adverse initial labor market conditions are primarily driven by economists who are white, male, non-US citizens, and graduating from tier 1 schools. We also explore the mechanisms underlying the effect of initial labor market conditions. The findings suggest that the increased extrinsic motivation may enhance social networks and research output during the initial four years, the anticipated attainment of tenure and the pursuit of post-doctoral positions may partially explain the reversal of impact in later years, and non-research factors may explain the diminished likelihood of achieving tenure at prestigious academic institutions.</font>

"Beyond Economic Benefits: Early Legal Access to Oral Contraceptives and Women’s Health Outcomes Over Life Cycle"

  <summary><font size="2">Abstract</font></summary>
  <font size="2">This paper investigates the effects of early legal access to oral contraceptives on women’s life-cycle health outcomes (e.g., mortality and self-reported disability) using the plausible quasi-experimental design introduced by Goldin and Katz (2002). The identification leverages the cross-state and cross-cohort variation in state consent laws. Utilizing the difference-in-differences approach, our results suggest that early access to the pill reduces women's mortality rates during their 30s and 40s, and the improvement in health is primarily driven by the decline in mortality rate caused by cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Also, we find that women who would have had early access to the pill are, on average, more likely to have self-reported physical disability during their late 50s and 60s. Additionally, our analysis reveals that non-white women experience greater benefits from early pill access. Our mechanism analysis identifies four potential channels: early access to the pill (1) rises in college completion, (2) increases (decreases) in oral contraceptive-related mortality, (3) increases (decreases) in health behavior measures, and (4) enhances life expectancy.</font>
