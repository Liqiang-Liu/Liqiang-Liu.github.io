This paper studies the impacts of initial labor market conditions on economists' early-career co-authorship networks and academic achievements. The identification leverages the plausibly exogenous variation in labor market conditions at initial entry, instrumented by predicted year of graduation unemployment rates. Utilizing new data collected on U.S. economics Ph.D. candidates from the top 10 departments, their co-authorship in the top 5 journals, and NBER affiliation, I find that economists graduating during adverse initial labor market conditions develop more extensive co-authorship networks and increase research output in their first five years post-graduation, with the difference diminishing afterward. The findings suggest that economists graduating during the Great Recession, who are male and non-US citizens, face reduced probabilities of securing tenure at top-ranked economics departments compared to their non-recession counterparts. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis reveals that adverse initial labor market conditions primarily affect economists who are white, male, non-US citizens, or graduating from Tier 1 schools. I also explore the mechanisms behind the effects. The results indicate that increased extrinsic motivation may boost early-career social networks and research output, while anticipated tenure and post-doctoral pursuits may partially explain the later impact reversal. Moreover, underperformance in non-research factors may account for reduced tenure prospects at top economics departments as research contributions remain statistically indifferent.

<div id="pill" style="display: none; text-align: justify; background-color:#fafdff; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
This paper investigates the effects of early legal access to oral contraceptives on women's life-cycle health outcomes (e.g., mortality and self-reported disability) using the plausible quasi-experimental design introduced by Goldin and Katz (2002). The identification leverages the cross-state and cross-cohort variation in state consent laws in the 1950s and the 1960s. Utilizing the difference-in-differences approach, the results suggest that early access to the pill reduces women's mortality rates during their 30s and 40s, and the health improvement is primarily driven by the decline in mortality rate caused by cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Furthermore, I find that women who would have had early pill access are, on average, more likely to have self-reported physical disability during their late 50s and 60s. Additionally, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that non-white women experience greater benefits from early pill access. My analysis identifies four potential mechanisms for observed impacts of early access to the pill: (1) increases in college completion, (2) changes in oral contraceptive-related mortality, (3) changes in health behavior measures, and (4) increases in life expectancy.

<div id="Surname" style="display: none; text-align: justify; background-color:#fafdff; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
The alphabetical ordering of authors is a prevalent convention in economics publications. This paper investigates the impacts of surname initials on occupational and location choices and career mobility between research-oriented and non-research-oriented positions among economics Ph.D. candidates. Utilizing a novel dataset of Ph.D. candidates graduating from the top 15 U.S. economics departments between 2007 and 2015, the findings suggest that candidates with surname initials closer to the end of the alphabet are more likely to opt for non-publication-oriented jobs, relocate to Asia, and exhibit a shift from publication-oriented to non-publication-oriented jobs over the longer term.

  <span style="font-family: pxfonts;"><font size="3">This paper studies the impacts of initial labor market conditions on young economists' early-career co-authorship networks and academic achievements. The identification leverages the plausibly exogenous variation in labor market conditions at initial entry instrumented by the unemployment rates of the predicted year of graduation. Using our three novel datasets (PhD Candidate, Top5 Co-authorship Network, and NBER Affiliated Scholar), we find that economists graduating during periods of elevated unemployment rates demonstrate expanded social networks and increased research output; however, the impact on research output diminishes after the fifth year following graduation. Furthermore, our findings suggest that recession economists who are male and non-US citizens encounter reduced probabilities of securing tenure positions at prestigious academic institutions. Additionally, our analysis of heterogeneity suggests that the effects of adverse initial labor market conditions are primarily driven by economists who are white, male, non-US citizens, and graduating from tier 1 schools. We also explore the mechanisms underlying the effect of initial labor market conditions. The findings suggest that the increased extrinsic motivation may enhance social networks and research output during the initial four years, the anticipated attainment of tenure and the pursuit of post-doctoral positions may partially explain the reversal of impact in later years, and non-research factors may explain the diminished likelihood of achieving tenure at prestigious academic institutions.</font></span>
